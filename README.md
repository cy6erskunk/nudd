# Up

Run this script to update your dependency urls to their latest published
versions. It's a fork of the original [up](https://github.com/hayd/deno-up)
package created from [Andy Hayden](https://github.com/hayd).

## Usage

For example, to update url imports inside `deps.ts` run:

```sh
up deps.ts
```

To update all the ts files in your directory:

```sh
up *.ts
```
